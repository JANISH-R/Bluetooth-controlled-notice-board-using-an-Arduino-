Explanation:
LedControl Library: This library is used for controlling the LED matrix. You can install it from the Arduino Library Manager.
Bluetooth Communication: The Arduino listens for incoming Bluetooth commands through the Serial port (HC-05 connected to the Arduino's RX/TX pins).
Display Logic: When a character is received via Bluetooth, the displayText() function displays the character on the LED matrix.
Smartphone/Control App:
You can use any Bluetooth terminal app (like the "Bluetooth Terminal" app for Android) to send characters to your Arduino. Every time you send a character, it will appear on the LED Matrix.
